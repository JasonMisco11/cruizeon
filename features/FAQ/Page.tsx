    question: "How much do you charge per kg?",
    answer: "Our rates are competitive and change slightly based on the season. Currently, Air Freight is approx $8-$10 per kg (USA/China to Ghana). Sea shipping is volume-based. Please chat with us on WhatsApp for today's exact rate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does delivery take?",
    answer: "Air Freight typically takes 5-7 business days from the day your package arrives at our foreign warehouse. Sea Shipping takes about 30-45 days. We send out shipment notifications every step of the way.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you buy the item for me?",
    answer: "Yes! termed 'Procurement Service'. If you don't have a credit card or the store doesn't accept GH cards, simply send us the link. We will buy it for you for a small service fee (usually 5-10%).",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to pay customs duty?",
    answer: "No additional stress for you. Our shipping fees are 'All-Inclusive', meaning we handle the clearing and customs charges at the port. The price we quote is the final price you pay to pick up your item.",
  },
  {
    question: "What items are prohibited?",
    answer: "We cannot ship explosives, illegal drugs, weapons, or flammable items. Perfumes and batteries (power banks) require special handling—please notify us before shipping these so we can categorize them safely.",
  },
